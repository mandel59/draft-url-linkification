# draft-url-linkification

This is an implementation of the algorithm proposed in [L2/24-122 Linkification of URLs](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2024/24122-url-linkification.pdf).

## Testing

1. Install Deno. See [deno.land](https://deno.land) for instructions.

2. Run the following command to test the implementation:

   ```sh
   deno test
   ```

## Disclaimer

This implementation is informal and is not guaranteed to work identically to the proposed algorithm. It is not intended to be used in production.
